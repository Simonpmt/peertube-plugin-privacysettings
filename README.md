## Use official plugin instead
There are now a official plugin with similar(and additional) functionality as this plugin, I would recommend using that instead:  
"privacy-remover"  
Sourcecode: https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/official-plugins/tree/master/peertube-plugin-privacy-remover  
NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/peertube-plugin-privacy-remover  

Screenshot from "Plugins/Themes" administration page:

## What does the plugin do?
Disables "Public", "Unlisted", "Private" and the option for password protection under Privacy on the publish/upload page, making the "Internal" setting the only available option.

## Versions
Use latest version (1.0.3) for PeerTube version 6.0.3 and higher.

For older versions use plugin version 1.0.0.
